        "description": "THE SIMPLE NETWORK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL (SNMP) SUBSYSTEM OF CISCO IOS 12.0 THROUGH 12.4 AND 15.0 THROUGH 15.6 AND IOS XE 2.2 THROUGH 3.17 CONTAINS MULTIPLE VULNERABILITIES THAT COULD ALLOW AN AUTHENTICATED, REMOTE ATTACKER TO REMOTELY EXECUTE CODE ON AN AFFECTED SYSTEM OR CAUSE AN AFFECTED SYSTEM TO RELOAD. AN ATTACKER COULD EXPLOIT THESE VULNERABILITIES BY SENDING A CRAFTED SNMP PACKET TO AN AFFECTED SYSTEM VIA IPV4 OR IPV6. ONLY TRAFFIC DIRECTED TO AN AFFECTED SYSTEM CAN BE USED TO EXPLOIT THESE VULNERABILITIES. THE VULNERABILITIES ARE DUE TO A BUFFER OVERFLOW CONDITION IN THE SNMP SUBSYSTEM OF THE AFFECTED SOFTWARE. THE VULNERABILITIES AFFECT ALL VERSIONS OF SNMP: VERSIONS 1, 2C, AND 3. TO EXPLOIT THESE VULNERABILITIES VIA SNMP VERSION 2C OR EARLIER, THE ATTACKER MUST KNOW THE SNMP READ-ONLY COMMUNITY STRING FOR THE AFFECTED SYSTEM. TO EXPLOIT THESE VULNERABILITIES VIA SNMP VERSION 3, THE ATTACKER MUST HAVE USER CREDENTIALS FOR THE AFFECTED SYSTEM. ALL DEVICES THAT HAVE ENABLED SNMP AND HAVE NOT EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED THE AFFECTED MIBS OR OIDS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED VULNERABLE. CISCO BUG IDS: CSCVE57697.",
