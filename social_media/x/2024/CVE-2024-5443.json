        "description": "CVE-2024-4320 DESCRIBES A VULNERABILITY IN THE PARISNEO/LOLLMS SOFTWARE, SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THE `EXTENSIONBUILDER().BUILD_EXTENSION()` FUNCTION. THE VULNERABILITY ARISES FROM THE `/MOUNT_EXTENSION` ENDPOINT, WHERE A PATH TRAVERSAL ISSUE ALLOWS ATTACKERS TO NAVIGATE BEYOND THE INTENDED DIRECTORY STRUCTURE. THIS IS FACILITATED BY THE `DATA.CATEGORY` AND `DATA.FOLDER` PARAMETERS ACCEPTING EMPTY STRINGS (``), WHICH, DUE TO INADEQUATE INPUT SANITIZATION, CAN LEAD TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF A `PACKAGE_PATH` THAT POINTS TO THE ROOT DIRECTORY. CONSEQUENTLY, IF AN ATTACKER CAN CREATE A `CONFIG.YAML` FILE IN A CONTROLLABLE PATH, THIS PATH CAN BE APPENDED TO THE `EXTENSIONS` LIST AND TRIGGER THE EXECUTION OF `__INIT__.PY` IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY, LEADING TO REMOTE CODE EXECUTION. THE VULNERABILITY AFFECTS VERSIONS UP TO 5.9.0, AND HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN VERSION 9.8.",
