AN ATTACKER COULD EXPLOIT THIS VULNERABILITY BY SENDING CRAFTED TRAFFIC THROUGH AN SD-WAN IPSEC TUNNEL THAT IS CONFIGURED ON AN AFFECTED DEVICE. A SUCCESSFUL EXPLOIT COULD ALLOW THE ATTACKER TO CAUSE THE DEVICE TO RELOAD, RESULTING IN A DOS CONDITION.\r\n\r NOTE: SD-WAN TUNNELS THAT ARE CONFIGURED WITH GENERIC ROUTING ENCAPSULATION (GRE) ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THIS VULNERABILITY.",
