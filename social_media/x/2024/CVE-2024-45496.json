DURING THE BUILD INITIALIZATION STEP, THE GIT-CLONE CONTAINER IS RUN WITH A PRIVILEGED SECURITY CONTEXT, ALLOWING UNRESTRICTED ACCESS TO THE NODE. AN ATTACKER WITH DEVELOPER-LEVEL ACCESS CAN PROVIDE A CRAFTED .GITCONFIG FILE CONTAINING COMMANDS EXECUTED DURING THE CLONING PROCESS, LEADING TO ARBITRARY COMMAND EXECUTION ON THE WORKER NODE. AN ATTACKER RUNNING CODE IN A PRIVILEGED CONTAINER COULD ESCALATE THEIR PERMISSIONS ON THE NODE RUNNING THE CONTAINER.",
