A VULNERABILITY THAT EXISTS IN VERSIONS PRIOR TO 2024.8.3 AND 2024.6.5 ALLOWS BYPASSING PASSWORD LOGIN BY ADDING X-FORWARDED-FOR HEADER WITH AN UNPARSABLE IP ADDRESS, E.G. `A`. THIS RESULTS IN A POSSIBILITY OF LOGGING INTO ANY ACCOUNT WITH A KNOWN LOGIN OR EMAIL ADDRESS. THE VULNERABILITY REQUIRES THE AUTHENTIK INSTANCE TO TRUST X-FORWARDED-FOR HEADER PROVIDED BY THE ATTACKER, THUS IT IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE FROM EXTERNAL HOSTS ON A PROPERLY CONFIGURED ENVIRONMENT.  THE ISSUE OCCURS DUE TO THE PASSWORD STAGE HAVING A POLICY BOUND TO IT, WHICH SKIPS THE PASSWORD STAGE IF THE IDENTIFICATION STAGE IS SETUP TO ALSO CONTAIN A PASSWORD STAGE. DUE TO THE INVALID X-FORWARDED-FOR HEADER, WHICH DOES NOT GET VALIDATED TO BE AN IP ADDRESS EARLY ENOUGH, THE EXCEPTION HAPPENS LATER AND THE POLICY FAILS. THE DEFAULT BLUEPRINT DOESNT CORRECTLY SET `FAILURE_RESULT` TO `TRUE` ON THE POLICY BINDING MEANING THAT DUE TO THIS EXCEPTION THE POLICY RETURNS FALSE AND THE PASSWORD STAGE IS SKIPPED.
