        "description": "KARMADA IS A KUBERNETES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS USERS TO RUN CLOUD-NATIVE APPLICATIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE KUBERNETES CLUSTERS AND CLOUDS. PRIOR TO VERSION 1.12.0, THE PULL MODE CLUSTERS REGISTERED WITH THE `KARMADACTL REGISTER` COMMAND HAVE EXCESSIVE PRIVILEGES TO ACCESS CONTROL PLANE RESOURCES. BY ABUSING THESE PERMISSIONS, AN ATTACKER ABLE TO AUTHENTICATE AS THE KARMADA-AGENT TO A KARMADA CLUSTER WOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE PRIVILEGES OVER THE ENTIRE FEDERATION SYSTEM INCLUDING ALL REGISTERED MEMBER CLUSTERS. SINCE KARMADA V1.12.0, COMMAND `KARMADACTL REGISTER` RESTRICTS THE ACCESS PERMISSIONS OF PULL MODE MEMBER CLUSTERS TO CONTROL PLANE RESOURCES. THIS WAY, AN ATTACKER ABLE TO AUTHENTICATE AS THE KARMADA-AGENT CANNOT CONTROL OTHER MEMBER CLUSTERS IN KARMADA. AS A WORKAROUND, ONE MAY RESTRICT THE ACCESS PERMISSIONS OF PULL MODE MEMBER CLUSTERS TO CONTROL PLANE RESOURCES ACCORDING TO KARMADA COMPONENT PERMISSIONS DOCS.",
