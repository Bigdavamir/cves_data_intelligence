WHEN CLOSING A BUFFER (VISIBLE IN A WINDOW) A BUFWINLEAVE AUTO COMMAND CAN CAUSE AN USE-AFTER-FREE IF THIS AUTO COMMAND HAPPENS TO RE-OPEN THE SAME BUFFER IN A NEW SPLIT WINDOW. IMPACT IS LOW SINCE THE USER MUST HAVE INTENTIONALLY SET UP SUCH A STRANGE AUTO COMMAND AND RUN SOME BUFFER UNLOAD COMMANDS. HOWEVER THIS MAY LEAD TO A CRASH. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN VERSION 9.1.0764 AND ALL USERS ARE ADVISED TO UPGRADE. THERE ARE NO KNOWN WORKAROUNDS FOR THIS VULNERABILITY.",
