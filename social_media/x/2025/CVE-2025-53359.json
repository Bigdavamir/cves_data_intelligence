PRIOR TO ETHEREUM CRATE V0.18.0, SIGNATURE MALLEABILITY (ACCORDING TO EIP-2) WAS ONLY CHECKED FOR LEGACY TRANSACTIONS, BUT NOT FOR EIP-2930, EIP-1559 AND EIP-7702 TRANSACTIONS. THIS IS A SPECIFICATION DEVIATION. THE SIGNATURE MALLEABILITY ITSELF IS NOT A SECURITY ISSUE AND NOT AS HIGH OF A RISK IF THE ETHEREUM CRATE IS USED ON A SINGLE-IMPLEMENTATION BLOCKCHAIN. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN PATCHED IN VERSION V0.18.0. A WORKAROUND FOR THIS ISSUE INVOLVES MANUALLY CHECKING TRANSACTION MALLEABILITY OUTSIDE OF THE CRATE, HOWEVER UPGRADING IS RECOMMENDED.",
