        "description": "OPENCTI IS AN OPEN-SOURCE CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM. IN VERSIONS STARTING FROM 6.4.8 TO BEFORE 6.4.10, THE ALLOW/DENY LISTS CAN BE BYPASSED, ALLOWING A USER TO CHANGE ATTRIBUTES THAT ARE INTENDED TO BE UNMODIFIABLE BY THE USER. IT IS POSSIBLE TO TOGGLE THE `EXTERNAL` FLAG ON/OFF AND CHANGE THE OWN TOKEN VALUE FOR A USER. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE TO EDIT ATTRIBUTES THAT ARE NOT IN THE ALLOW LIST, SUCH AS `OTP_QR` AND `OTP_ACTIVATED`. IF EXTERNAL USERS EXIST IN THE OPENCTI SETUP AND THE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE USERS IDENTITIES IS SENSITIVE, THE ABOVE VULNERABILITIES CAN BE USED TO ENUMERATE EXISTING USER ACCOUNTS AS A STANDARD LOW PRIVILEGED USER. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN PATCHED IN VERSION 6.4.10.",
