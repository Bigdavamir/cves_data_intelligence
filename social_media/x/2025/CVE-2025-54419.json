THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE PARTS THAT ARE VERIFIED WHEN CHECKING SIGNATURE. THIS ALLOWS AN ATTACKER TO MODIFY AUTHENTICATION DETAILS WITHIN A VALID SAML ASSERTION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN ONE ATTACK IT IS POSSIBLE TO REMOVE ANY CHARACTER FROM THE SAML ASSERTION USERNAME. TO CONDUCT THE ATTACK AN ATTACKER WOULD NEED A VALIDLY SIGNED DOCUMENT FROM THE IDENTITY PROVIDER (IDP). THIS IS FIXED IN VERSION 5.1.0.",
