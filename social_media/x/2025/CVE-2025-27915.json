        "description": "AN ISSUE WAS DISCOVERED IN ZIMBRA COLLABORATION (ZCS) 9.0 AND 10.0 AND 10.1. A STORED CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS) VULNERABILITY EXISTS IN THE CLASSIC WEB CLIENT DUE TO INSUFFICIENT SANITIZATION OF HTML CONTENT IN ICS FILES. WHEN A USER VIEWS AN E-MAIL MESSAGE CONTAINING A MALICIOUS ICS ENTRY, ITS EMBEDDED JAVASCRIPT EXECUTES VIA AN ONTOGGLE EVENT INSIDE A <DETAILS> TAG. THIS ALLOWS AN ATTACKER TO RUN ARBITRARY JAVASCRIPT WITHIN THE VICTIMS SESSION, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO UNAUTHORIZED ACTIONS SUCH AS SETTING E-MAIL FILTERS TO REDIRECT MESSAGES TO AN ATTACKER-CONTROLLED ADDRESS. AS A RESULT, AN ATTACKER CAN PERFORM UNAUTHORIZED ACTIONS ON THE VICTIMS ACCOUNT, INCLUDING E-MAIL REDIRECTION AND DATA EXFILTRATION.",
