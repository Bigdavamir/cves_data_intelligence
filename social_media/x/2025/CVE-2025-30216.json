        "description": "CRYPTOLIB PROVIDES A SOFTWARE-ONLY SOLUTION USING THE CCSDS SPACE DATA LINK SECURITY PROTOCOL - EXTENDED PROCEDURES (SDLS-EP) TO SECURE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN A SPACECRAFT RUNNING THE CORE FLIGHT SYSTEM (CFS) AND A GROUND STATION. IN VERSIONS 1.3.3 AND PRIOR, A HEAP OVERFLOW VULNERABILITY OCCURS IN THE `CRYPTO_TM_PROCESSSECURITY` FUNCTION (`CRYPTO_TM.C:1735:8`). WHEN PROCESSING THE SECONDARY HEADER LENGTH OF A TM PROTOCOL PACKET, IF THE SECONDARY HEADER LENGTH EXCEEDS THE PACKETS TOTAL LENGTH, A HEAP OVERFLOW IS TRIGGERED DURING THE MEMCPY OPERATION THAT COPIES PACKET DATA INTO THE DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED BUFFER `P_NEW_DEC_FRAME`. THIS ALLOWS AN ATTACKER TO OVERWRITE ADJACENT HEAP MEMORY, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO ARBITRARY CODE EXECUTION OR SYSTEM INSTABILITY. A PATCH IS AVAILABLE AT COMMIT 810FD66D592C883125272FEF123C3240DB2F170F.",
