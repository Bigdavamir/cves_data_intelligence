        "description": "CPP-HTTPLIB IS A C++ HEADER-ONLY HTTP/HTTPS SERVER AND CLIENT LIBRARY. PRIOR TO VERSION 0.20.1, THE LIBRARY FAILS TO ENFORCE CONFIGURED SIZE LIMITS ON INCOMING REQUEST BODIES WHEN `TRANSFER-ENCODING: CHUNKED` IS USED OR WHEN NO `CONTENT-LENGTH` HEADER IS PROVIDED. A REMOTE ATTACKER CAN SEND A CHUNKED REQUEST WITHOUT THE TERMINATING ZERO-LENGTH CHUNK, CAUSING UNCONTROLLED MEMORY ALLOCATION ON THE SERVER. THIS LEADS TO POTENTIAL EXHAUSTION OF SYSTEM MEMORY AND RESULTS IN A SERVER CRASH OR UNRESPONSIVENESS. VERSION 0.20.1 FIXES THE ISSUE BY ENFORCING LIMITS DURING PARSING. IF THE LIMIT IS EXCEEDED AT ANY POINT DURING READING, THE CONNECTION IS TERMINATED IMMEDIATELY. A SHORT-TERM WORKAROUND THROUGH A REVERSE PROXY IS AVAILABLE. IF UPDATING THE LIBRARY IMMEDIATELY IS NOT FEASIBLE, DEPLOY A REVERSE PROXY (E.G., NGINX, HAPROXY) IN FRONT OF THE `CPP-HTTPLIB` APPLICATION. CONFIGURE THE PROXY TO ENFORCE MAXIMUM REQUEST BODY SIZE LIMITS, THEREBY STOPPING EXCESSIVELY LARGE REQUESTS BEFORE THEY REACH THE VULNERABLE LIBRARY CODE.",
