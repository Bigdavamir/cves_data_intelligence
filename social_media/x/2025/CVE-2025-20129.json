AN ATTACKER COULD EXPLOIT THIS VULNERABILITY BY SENDING CRAFTED HTTP REQUESTS TO THE CHAT INTERFACE OF A TARGETED USER ON A VULNERABLE SERVER. A SUCCESSFUL EXPLOIT COULD ALLOW THE ATTACKER TO REDIRECT CHAT TRAFFIC TO A SERVER THAT IS UNDER THEIR CONTROL, RESULTING IN SENSITIVE INFORMATION BEING REDIRECTED TO THE ATTACKER.",
