THE FREEIPA PACKAGE FAILS TO VALIDATE THE UNIQUENESS OF THE `KRBCANONICALNAME` FOR THE ADMIN ACCOUNT BY DEFAULT, ALLOWING USERS TO CREATE SERVICES WITH THE SAME CANONICAL NAME AS THE REALM ADMIN. WHEN A SUCCESSFUL ATTACK HAPPENS, THE USER CAN RETRIEVE A KERBEROS TICKET IN THE NAME OF THIS SERVICE, CONTAINING THE ADMIN@REALM CREDENTIAL. THIS FLAW ALLOWS AN ATTACKER TO PERFORM ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS OVER THE REALM, LEADING TO ACCESS TO SENSITIVE DATA AND SENSITIVE DATA EXFILTRATION.",
