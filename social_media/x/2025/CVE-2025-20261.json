AN ATTACKER WITH A VALID USER ACCOUNT COULD EXPLOIT THIS VULNERABILITY BY USING CRAFTED SYNTAX WHEN CONNECTING TO THE CISCO IMC OF AN AFFECTED DEVICE THROUGH SSH. A SUCCESSFUL EXPLOIT COULD ALLOW THE ATTACKER TO ACCESS INTERNAL SERVICES WITH ELEVATED PRIVILEGES, WHICH MAY ALLOW UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATIONS TO THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF CREATING NEW ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNTS ON THE AFFECTED DEVICE.",
