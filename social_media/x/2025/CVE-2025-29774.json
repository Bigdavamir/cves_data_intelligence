        "description": "XML-CRYPTO IS AN XML DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND ENCRYPTION LIBRARY FOR NODE.JS. AN ATTACKER MAY BE ABLE TO EXPLOIT A VULNERABILITY IN VERSIONS PRIOR TO 6.0.1, 3.2.1, AND 2.1.6 TO BYPASS AUTHENTICATION OR AUTHORIZATION MECHANISMS IN SYSTEMS THAT RELY ON XML-CRYPTO FOR VERIFYING SIGNED XML DOCUMENTS. THE VULNERABILITY ALLOWS AN ATTACKER TO MODIFY A VALID SIGNED XML MESSAGE IN A WAY THAT STILL PASSES SIGNATURE VERIFICATION CHECKS. FOR EXAMPLE, IT COULD BE USED TO ALTER CRITICAL IDENTITY OR ACCESS CONTROL ATTRIBUTES, ENABLING AN ATTACKER WITH A VALID ACCOUNT TO ESCALATE PRIVILEGES OR IMPERSONATE ANOTHER USER. USERS OF VERSIONS 6.0.0 AND PRIOR SHOULD UPGRADE TO VERSION 6.0.1 TO RECEIVE A FIX. THOSE WHO ARE STILL USING V2.X OR V3.X SHOULD UPGRADE TO PATCHED VERSIONS 2.1.6 OR 3.2.1, RESPECTIVELY.",
