PRIOR TO VERSIONS OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, AND OTP-25.3.2.20, A SSH SERVER MAY ALLOW AN ATTACKER TO PERFORM UNAUTHENTICATED REMOTE CODE EXECUTION (RCE). BY EXPLOITING A FLAW IN SSH PROTOCOL MESSAGE HANDLING, A MALICIOUS ACTOR COULD GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO AFFECTED SYSTEMS AND EXECUTE ARBITRARY COMMANDS WITHOUT VALID CREDENTIALS. THIS ISSUE IS PATCHED IN VERSIONS OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, AND OTP-25.3.2.20. A TEMPORARY WORKAROUND INVOLVES DISABLING THE SSH SERVER OR TO PREVENT ACCESS VIA FIREWALL RULES.",
