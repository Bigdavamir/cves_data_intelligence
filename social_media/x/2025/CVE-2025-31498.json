        "description": "C-ARES IS AN ASYNCHRONOUS RESOLVER LIBRARY. FROM 1.32.3 THROUGH 1.34.4, THERE IS A USE-AFTER-FREE IN READ_ANSWERS() WHEN PROCESS_ANSWER() MAY RE-ENQUEUE A QUERY EITHER DUE TO A DNS COOKIE FAILURE OR WHEN THE UPSTREAM SERVER DOES NOT PROPERLY SUPPORT EDNS, OR POSSIBLY ON TCP QUERIES IF THE REMOTE CLOSED THE CONNECTION IMMEDIATELY AFTER A RESPONSE. IF THERE WAS AN ISSUE TRYING TO PUT THAT NEW TRANSACTION ON THE WIRE, IT WOULD CLOSE THE CONNECTION HANDLE, BUT READ_ANSWERS() WAS STILL EXPECTING THE CONNECTION HANDLE TO BE AVAILABLE TO POSSIBLY DEQUEUE OTHER RESPONSES. IN THEORY A REMOTE ATTACKER MIGHT BE ABLE TO TRIGGER THIS BY FLOODING THE TARGET WITH ICMP UNREACHABLE PACKETS IF THEY ALSO CONTROL THE UPSTREAM NAMESERVER AND CAN RETURN A RESULT WITH ONE OF THOSE CONDITIONS, THIS HAS BEEN UNTESTED. OTHERWISE ONLY A LOCAL ATTACKER MIGHT BE ABLE TO CHANGE SYSTEM BEHAVIOR TO MAKE SEND()/WRITE() RETURN A FAILURE CONDITION. THIS VULNERABILITY IS FIXED IN 1.34.5.",
