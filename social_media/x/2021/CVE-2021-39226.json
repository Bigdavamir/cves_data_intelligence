        "description": "GRAFANA IS AN OPEN SOURCE DATA VISUALIZATION PLATFORM. IN AFFECTED VERSIONS UNAUTHENTICATED AND AUTHENTICATED USERS ARE ABLE TO VIEW THE SNAPSHOT WITH THE LOWEST DATABASE KEY BY ACCESSING THE LITERAL PATHS: /DASHBOARD/SNAPSHOT/:KEY, OR /API/SNAPSHOTS/:KEY. IF THE SNAPSHOT PUBLIC_MODE CONFIGURATION SETTING IS SET TO TRUE (VS DEFAULT OF FALSE), UNAUTHENTICATED USERS ARE ABLE TO DELETE THE SNAPSHOT WITH THE LOWEST DATABASE KEY BY ACCESSING THE LITERAL PATH: /API/SNAPSHOTS-DELETE/:DELETEKEY. REGARDLESS OF THE SNAPSHOT PUBLIC_MODE SETTING, AUTHENTICATED USERS ARE ABLE TO DELETE THE SNAPSHOT WITH THE LOWEST DATABASE KEY BY ACCESSING THE LITERAL PATHS: /API/SNAPSHOTS/:KEY, OR /API/SNAPSHOTS-DELETE/:DELETEKEY. THE COMBINATION OF DELETION AND VIEWING ENABLES A COMPLETE WALK THROUGH ALL SNAPSHOT DATA WHILE RESULTING IN COMPLETE SNAPSHOT DATA LOSS. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED IN VERSIONS 8.1.6 AND 7.5.11. IF FOR SOME REASON YOU CANNOT UPGRADE YOU CAN USE A REVERSE PROXY OR SIMILAR TO BLOCK ACCESS TO THE LITERAL PATHS: /API/SNAPSHOTS/:KEY, /API/SNAPSHOTS-DELETE/:DELETEKEY, /DASHBOARD/SNAPSHOT/:KEY, AND /API/SNAPSHOTS/:KEY. THEY HAVE NO NORMAL FUNCTION AND CAN BE DISABLED WITHOUT SIDE EFFECTS.",
