THIS ISSUE MAY HAPPEN IF THERE IS INSUFFICIENT MEMORY OR THE MEMORY USAGE IS LIMITED. THE PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY THE RETURN VALUE `RC,` WHICH IS INITIALIZED TO SSH_ERROR AND LATER REWRITTEN TO SAVE THE RETURN VALUE OF THE FUNCTION CALL `PKI_KEY_CHECK_HASH_COMPATIBLE.` THE VALUE OF THE VARIABLE IS NOT CHANGED BETWEEN THIS POINT AND THE CRYPTOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION. THEREFORE ANY ERROR BETWEEN THEM CALLS `GOTO ERROR` RETURNING SSH_OK.",
