AN ATTACKER COULD EXPLOIT THIS VULNERABILITY BY SENDING A CRAFTED HTTP REQUEST TO THE WEB-BASED MANAGEMENT INTERFACE. A SUCCESSFUL EXPLOIT COULD ALLOW THE ATTACKER TO GAIN ROOT-LEVEL PRIVILEGES AND ACCESS UNAUTHORIZED DATA. TO EXPLOIT THIS VULNERABILITY, AN ATTACKER WOULD NEED TO HAVE VALID ADMINISTRATIVE CREDENTIALS ON THE AFFECTED DEVICE.\r\n\r CISCO HAS NOT AND WILL NOT RELEASE SOFTWARE UPDATES THAT ADDRESS THIS VULNERABILITY.",
