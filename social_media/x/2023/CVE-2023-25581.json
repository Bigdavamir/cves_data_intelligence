THE VULNERABILITY AFFECTS SYSTEMS THAT STORE EXTERNALLY CONTROLLED VALUES IN ATTRIBUTES OF THE `USERPROFILE` CLASS FROM PAC4J-CORE. IT CAN BE EXPLOITED BY PROVIDING AN ATTRIBUTE THAT CONTAINS A SERIALIZED JAVA OBJECT WITH A SPECIAL PREFIX `{#SB64}` AND BASE64 ENCODING. THIS ISSUE MAY LEAD TO REMOTE CODE EXECUTION (RCE) IN THE WORST CASE. ALTHOUGH A `RESTRICTEDOBJECTINPUTSTREAM` IS IN PLACE, THAT PUTS SOME RESTRICTION ON WHAT CLASSES CAN BE DESERIALIZED, IT STILL ALLOWS A BROAD RANGE OF JAVA PACKAGES AND POTENTIALLY EXPLOITABLE WITH DIFFERENT GADGET CHAINS.
